This is a sample text file for Huffman encoding demonstration.

Huffman coding is an optimal prefix-free encoding algorithm that was
developed by David Huffman in 1952 while he was a student at MIT.

The algorithm builds a binary tree where more frequent characters are
assigned shorter codes, and less frequent characters get longer codes.

Character frequency analysis:
- In English text, the letter 'e' is most common
- Spaces are also very frequent
- Letters like 'z' and 'q' are rare

This file contains enough text to demonstrate meaningful compression
ratios when using Huffman encoding versus fixed-length codes.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!

These sentences (pangrams) contain all letters of the alphabet and
are useful for testing encoding algorithms.
